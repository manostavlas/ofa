  '--------------------------------------'

    "ofa" is an acronym for "optimal flexible architecture".
    This term was originally coined by a reknowned database vendor, but
    can be applied anywhere. 

    This "ofa" can be configured to implement its users' flavor of 
    Database OFA. 
    However, it also implements a generic "ofa" at the Unix shell via 
    a set of libraries and a handful conventions. 

    It effectively constitutes a little framework that makes scripting
    very easy: it takes care of log management, error checking, error 
    reporting, mail, and even doumentation. 

    It supports parameter files for scripts that do away with command
    line switches and options handling.

    It makes the Unix backend uniform and easy to manage all the while
    allowing for maximum flexibility. 

    It supports the notion of graft products, which are product-specific
    modules -e.g. Oracle or Sybase -  that provide functionality within 
    the "ofa". 

    The ofa can easily and indefinitely be extended with such modules.
