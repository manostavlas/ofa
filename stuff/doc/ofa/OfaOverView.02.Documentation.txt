  The ofa has a tightly integrated documentation system that works on the
  basis of introspection. It dynamically extracts information about
  all its constituent parts as required and presents them in a uniform
  way. 

    In Scripts
    ----------

      Usage

          The ofa base library has a Function called "Usage" that invokes this
          instrospective help system on the running script. 
          When invoked from within a script, it displays all documentation available 
          from the script and its parameter files, then terminates the script.

             Usage "Script takes no arguments" 

      Documenting Scripts

          Ofa extracts textual documentation from scripts, functions and parameter
          files by looking for lines starting with double sharps - "##", or "--REM"
          (in SQL scripts). 
          Effective documenting is done by using the documentation template, 
          which is displayed by the OfaDocTemplate function. 

    Interactive
    -----------

      The ofa documentation system is aliased "ofa", so anyone with the ability
      to remember these three letters has the potential of becoming proficient 
      in ofa.

      Documentation about any script, variable, function or alias  can be 
      retrieved by typing "ofa <token>", or something close.

        - ofa                                # This documentation
        - ofa <thing>                        # documentation on a token
        - ofa list [<thing>]                 # list corresponding tokens
        - ofa function|script|variable|alias # list functions, scripts, variables, aliases
        - ofa map                            # Show Ofa File Resource Map
        - ofa env                            # Show Resource Paths with current assignments
        - ofa doc                            # Display this documention
        - ver                                # Show Version Information

      Note: in sripts, use the function "OfaHelp" rather than its alias "ofa" 
            (some shells don't allow aliases in scripts).

      Special Tokens 

          ofa map
      
              Displays the ofa resource map file. 
              This map indicates all file resources the ofa uses. 
              It is a key resource for scripting and exposes the essence of ofa's structure.

          ver

              An alias for the OfaShowVersion function. 
              "Version" information is ofa-specific and has nothing to do with any VCS. 
              This function reveals more detail from volume level 3 upward. 
              It can be used to check the current build, product, and whether anything was
              modified since install.
  
      Hidden Things

          Some things are hidden from the documentation system:
          functions whose names start with an underscore "_". 
          Those are "internal" functions that are of no interest to the end user.

      Splash Screen

         Each Graft Product can have a splash screen, which is found in 
         $OFA_DOC/$OFA_GRAFT/OfaBonJour.$OFA_GRAFT.txt.

         Properly maintained, it can serve as top-level documentation.
         At the command line, the loader shows it when OFA_SPLASH <> 0

         The aliases "hi" and "bj" also bring up the splash sceen.
