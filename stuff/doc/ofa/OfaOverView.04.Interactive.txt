  Three cases
  -----------

  There are three possible situations in a shell environment.
  The ofa distinguishes between them through test functions:

    - Interactive CLI       - IsInterActiveCLI
    - Interactive (script)  - IsInterActive
    - Background  (script)  - IsScript + IsInterActive

    Some functions and scripts adapt their behaviour, e.g.: 

      - The BailOut function does not "exit" outside a script. 
      - The ofa_step.sh script does not attempt to prompt when not interactive. 
        This makes it suitable for interactive and batch processing alike. 

  Standard Functionality
  ----------------------
 
  Ofa loads some functions and settings and aliases when interactive. 

    CDPATH

      For one, the CDPATH is extended to navigate the ofa directory structure. 
      This lets you navigate e.g. to the etc, bin or logs directories with short
      syntax such as "cd bin", wherever you are. 

    Documentation

      In interactive mode, Documentation is invoked through the alias "ofa". 
      This alias underscores the fact that "ofa" is its own documentation system. 
      See the section "Documentation" for more. 

  Other Functionality
  -------------------

      Interactive functionality is added depending on the graft product through
      the relevant Resource paths. Type "ofa map" to see them.

      General Documentation pertaining to the Graft Product is displayed with the 
      top-level documentation obtained by typing "ofa" at the command prompt. 

  Interactive vs. Script
  ----------------------

  It is worth noting that the ofa environment is not exported. 
  A script will know nothing about your interactive ofa environment - it has no access to it. 

  Therefore, the ofa environment loaded within a script is "completely fresh".  

  There are few exceptions: 

    OFA_CONS_VOL 

      Console output volume is regulated by the variable OFA_CONS_VOL. 
      This variable is always exported and not overridden by the loader. 
      This allows you to pre-set the output volume for a script without modifying
      its parameters, e.g.:

        VolSet 3  # subsequent script becomes more verbose

    OFA_GRAFT 

        May be exported to preset and override the Graft Product "hardwired from $HOME"
        esp. at the master, where you want to be able to switch products.
        Note that this variable is not exported by default.

  Profile
  -------

    To load ofa in interactlively, it is most adviseable to have this alias in your
    Unix profile: 

    alias ofa2=". ~/*/local/$(id | sed 's/[()]/ /g' | awk '{print $2'})/etc/ofa/0fa_load.rc"
    tty -s && echo "# \"ofa2\" loads ofa (v2) #"
