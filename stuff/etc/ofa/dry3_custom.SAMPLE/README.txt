The directories here are represent variables by their names. 
They contain files, whose names can become the values of these
variables. 
This occurs when a token is matched within on of those files. 

To add a variable, simply create a directory and put files in it whose names
will be used as values. Populate these files with tokens that can be matched
to make such an assignment happen.

This structure has been specifically designed as the data source for the LoadSiteSettings function.
See that function's documentation for details.
